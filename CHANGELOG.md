# Changelog

All notable changes to AIDA Core Plugin.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.4.8] - 2026-04-30

### Added

- SPDX copyright/license headers on every hand-authored source file
  (markdown, Python, YAML, shell, Makefiles, Dockerfiles,
  requirements files): copyright "The AIDA Core Authors" / license
  MPL-2.0. Inserted via the new `scripts/add_spdx_headers.py`
  (idempotent, dry-run by default), which respects skip categories
  from
  [.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#licensing](https://github.com/aida-core/.github/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#licensing):
  JSON, lockfiles, fixtures, scaffolding templates, and `LICENSE`
  itself. Refs #72, #73
- `REUSE.toml` at the repo root licensing the skip categories that
  cannot carry inline headers (JSON, dotfiles, scaffolding templates,
  integration test fixtures). Copyright is attributed to "The AIDA
  Core Authors" with the contributor roster in `AUTHORS`
- `LICENSES/MPL-2.0.txt` (REUSE-required canonical license text;
  `LICENSE` at repo root remains for GitHub display)
- `lint-reuse` Makefile target running `reuse lint`; wired into
  `make lint` so the existing CI lint job becomes the blocking gate
  for REUSE compliance. Project is REUSE 3.3 compliant
- `reuse>=4.0` dev dependency

### Notes

- Scaffolding tools (`plugin-manager`, `agent-manager`,
  `skill-manager`, `claude-md-manager`, `hook-manager`) do **not**
  emit SPDX headers in generated artifacts yet — that's the next PR
  on #73. Templates themselves are intentionally header-free
  (`REUSE.toml` covers them) so the renderer controls the year and
  copyright holder per generated artifact

---

## [1.4.6] - 2026-04-28

### Added

- CI workflow `check-attribution` that scans PR commit messages for
  `Co-Authored-By` trailers referencing AI tools (Claude, Anthropic,
  OpenAI, ChatGPT, Copilot, Gemini, generic `ai`) and fails the build
  if any are found. Copyright clarity concern: AI co-authorship trailers
  create copyright ownership ambiguity. Closes #54

### Changed

- Rewrote commit `4c80c92` (the v1.4.2 backfill commit) to remove a
  pre-existing `Co-Authored-By: Claude` trailer; force-updated `main`
  and re-pointed tags v1.4.2/v1.4.3/v1.4.4/v1.4.5 at their new SHAs.
  GitHub releases follow the moved tags. Old SHAs remain reachable as
  orphans for anyone with stale clones — `git fetch && git reset --hard
  origin/main` will catch them up

---

## [1.4.5] - 2026-04-28

### Changed

- `/aida config` now writes the project context as **two files**: the
  committable `.claude/aida-project-context.yml` (project-level facts:
  vcs.type, languages, tools, preferences, etc.) and the gitignored
  `.claude/aida-project-context.local.yml` (user/environment overlay:
  `project_root`, `vcs.remote_url`, `last_updated`, `config_complete`).
  Fixes #65 — previously the single file mixed both, making it
  impractical to commit
- Phase 2 of `/aida config` appends `.claude/aida-project-context.local.yml`
  to the project's `.gitignore` (if one exists and the entry is missing).
  No `.gitignore` is created — that decision stays with the project
- New `utils.project_context` module (`load_project_context`,
  `write_project_context`, `split_context`, `merge_context`,
  `ensure_gitignore_entry`) for consumers that need to read the merged
  view

### Migration

- Legacy single-file projects continue to read correctly via
  `load_project_context()`. The split happens automatically on the next
  `/aida config` run; no manual migration is required
- Existing committed `aida-project-context.yml` files with stale paths
  from another contributor will be cleaned up on next config run

---

## [1.4.4] - 2026-04-28

### Changed

- User-facing docs updated to reflect the org rename from `oakensoul/`
  to `aida-core/`: `README.md`, `docs/GETTING_STARTED.md`,
  `docs/USER_GUIDE_INSTALL.md`, `docs/DEVELOPMENT.md`,
  `docs/EXAMPLES.md`, ADRs 006 and 008,
  `docs/architecture/c4/container-diagram.md`, and the `feedback.md`
  skill reference. Also normalizes a stale `/Users/oakensoul/...` path
  example in `config-driven-approach.md`
- Historical CHANGELOG link footnotes and `.issues/`/`.github/issues/`
  archives intentionally left untouched (covered by GitHub redirects;
  preserves accurate historical record)

---

## [1.4.3] - 2026-04-28

### Changed

- Updated internal references from `oakensoul/` to `aida-core/` after
  the GitHub org transfer on 2026-04-28: `plugin.json` `repository`
  field, `gh api` calls in `upgrade.py`, `FEEDBACK_REPO` and
  user-visible prompts in `feedback.py`, the scaffolded plugin README
  template, and corresponding test assertions
- User-facing docs and historical changelog/issue archives are
  unchanged (covered by GitHub redirects); a separate docs PR will
  follow

---

## [1.4.2] - 2026-04-24

### Changed

- Backfilled missing release tags and GitHub releases so the published
  release history matches the changelog: tagged `v1.2.1` at the PR #58
  merge commit and `v1.4.1` at the PR #62 merge commit, and published
  GitHub releases for `v1.2.1`, `v1.4.0`, and `v1.4.1`
- Added missing CHANGELOG reference links for 1.1.2–1.1.5, 1.4.1, and
  1.4.2

---

## [1.4.1] - 2026-04-24

### Changed

- Scaffold default license is now `UNLICENSED` instead of `MIT`
- Scaffolded `.gitignore` no longer auto-ignores the entire
  `.claude/` directory; only `.claude/settings.local.json` (the
  one file Claude Code designates as local-only) is ignored

## [1.4.0] - 2026-04-16

### Added

#### Expert Registry Skill

- New `/aida expert` command family for managing expert agents
- Expert activation at project and global scopes with layered
  resolution (project overrides global)
- Named panel compositions for grouped expert workflows
  (code review, plan grading)
- `expert-role` frontmatter field on agents (`core`, `domain`, `qa`)
  for role-based filtering
- Commands: `list`, `configure`, `panels`, `panel create`,
  `panel remove`
- Two-phase API following ADR-010 pattern
- Project config schema bumped to v0.3.0 with `experts` section
- Post-configuration nudge when expert agents are detected
- 19 new unit tests (11 registry, 8 panels)

#### Version & Changelog CI check

- Added `.github/workflows/version-check.yml` that runs on every PR to
  `main` and fails the build if `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` version
  was not bumped or if `CHANGELOG.md` lacks a matching
  `## [<version>] - YYYY-MM-DD` entry
- Enforces semver bump direction (head version must be greater than base)
- Intent: every change — including typo fixes — updates the version so
  the release history stays aligned with the code, even when a version
  is not separately tagged

---

## [1.2.1] - 2026-04-16

### Fixed

#### Replace pinned model versions with family aliases (#56)

- Replaced version-pinned model identifiers (`claude-opus-4-6`,
  `claude-sonnet-4-6`, `claude-haiku-4-5`) with family aliases (`opus`,
  `sonnet`, `haiku`) across knowledge docs, reference schemas, and tests
- Ensures model references stay valid as new Claude versions ship without
  requiring downstream doc updates

---

## [1.2.0] - 2026-03-18

### Added

#### `/aida about` command and version in help text (#51)

- Added `/aida about` command to display plugin version, author, and
  repository from `plugin.json`
- Updated `/aida help` to include version footer
- Reorganized help text "Info" section with `help`, `about`, `status`

---

## [1.1.5] - 2026-03-18

### Fixed

#### Generated SKILL.md has multiple consecutive blank lines (#49)

- Added `trim_blocks`, `lstrip_blocks`, and `keep_trailing_newline`
  to `template_renderer.py` SandboxedEnvironment — this was the
  actual production renderer used by `configure.py`, which lacked
  the whitespace settings present in `shared/utils.py`
- Added post-processing safety net in `render_skill_directory()` to
  collapse 3+ consecutive newlines to a single blank line
- Added 5 tests using the production SandboxedEnvironment renderer
  covering all-true, all-false, and mixed (marketplace-like) inputs

---

## [1.1.4] - 2026-03-18

### Fixed

#### Scripts invoked with bare python3 instead of AIDA venv (#47)

- Updated all reference docs to invoke scripts via
  `~/.aida/venv/bin/python3` instead of bare `python3`
- Fixed Makefile `lint-frontmatter` target to use `$(VENV_BIN)/python3`
- Updated troubleshooting docs to reference venv Python path
- Affected files: `config.md`, `diagnostics.md`, `feedback.md`,
  `permissions-workflow.md`, `troubleshooting.md`, `Makefile`

---

## [1.1.3] - 2026-03-18

### Fixed

#### Config bugs: hardcoded version and missing project marker (#45)

- Replaced hardcoded `AIDA_VERSION = "0.7.0"` with dynamic version
  read from `plugin.json`, so `aida-project-context.yml` reflects
  the actual plugin version
- Added call to `render_aida_project_marker()` at the end of the
  configure flow, writing `.claude/aida.yml` so `detect.py` correctly
  reports `project_configured: true` after configuration

---

## [1.1.2] - 2026-03-18

### Fixed

#### Generated project-context SKILL.md fails markdown linting (#41)

- Changed 9 `'None'` string fallbacks to `''` in `configure.py` so
  Jinja2 conditionals correctly skip missing values
- Fixed all `{% if has_xxx %}` boolean checks to use
  `{% if has_xxx == 'true' %}` since values are strings
- Removed `| join()` and `[0]` indexing on string values that were
  incorrectly treated as lists
- Restructured template whitespace control to eliminate MD012
  (multiple blank lines) and MD032 (blanks around lists)
- Changed footer emphasis lines to HTML comments (fixes MD036)
- Fixed `tools` default to handle empty strings
- Added 19 unit tests for template rendering

---

## [1.1.1] - 2026-03-18

### Fixed

#### Missing `_paths` import in install.py (#42)

- Added `import _paths` to `install.py` before `from utils import`
  block, fixing `ModuleNotFoundError` when invoked via `/aida config`
  → "Update global preferences"

### Changed

#### Dev tooling uses AIDA-managed venv (#42)

- Added `requirements-dev.txt` for dev dependencies (pytest, ruff,
  yamllint)
- Makefile targets now use `~/.aida/venv/bin/` for all Python tools
- `make install` installs both runtime and dev deps into the venv
- Updated CLAUDE.md with setup instructions

---

## [1.1.0] - 2026-03-05

### Added

#### AIDA-managed Virtual Environment (#34)

- Bootstrap module (`scripts/shared/bootstrap.py`) that lazily creates
  and maintains a virtual environment at `~/.aida/venv/`
- Unified dependency management -- no manual `pip install` required
- Stamp file tracking to skip reinstall when dependencies haven't changed
- Venv health check in `/aida doctor`
- Optional AIDA bootstrap integration for skill creation flow
- Standardized `_paths.py` across all 8 skills

### Removed

- Ad-hoc "Install with: pip install ..." error messages from 6 scripts

## [1.0.0] - 2026-02-24

### Added

#### Plugin Scaffolding Skill (#23)

- Two-phase API for creating new plugins from templates
- Interactive setup with marketplace configuration

#### Plugin Update Skill (#27)

- `/aida plugin update` for standards migration
- Guides plugins through convention changes

### Changed

#### Decompose claude-code-management into Focused Skills (#31)

- Extracted `agent-manager`, `skill-manager`, `plugin-manager`,
  `hook-manager`, and `claude-md-manager` as standalone skills
- Shared logic moved to `extension_utils` module
- Standardized validate response shapes and default operations
- Replaced hand-rolled YAML parser with PyYAML
- Added `operation` key to list responses

#### Merge aida-dispatch into aida Skill (#24)

- Unified `/aida` routing into a single `aida` skill
- Removed `aida-dispatch` as a separate skill

#### Updated Knowledge Base (#31)

- Refreshed all 10 claude-code-expert knowledge files with current
  Claude Code capabilities

### Fixed

- Short-circuit permissions flow when no plugin recommendations
  exist (#28)

---

## [0.8.0] - 2026-02-23

### Changed

#### Merge Commands into Skills (#19)

- Eliminated "Command" as a separate extension type, aligning with Anthropic's
  upstream merge of commands into skills in Claude Code
- Migrated `commands/aida.md` to `skills/aida/SKILL.md` with `user-invocable: true`
  frontmatter field
- Removed `commands/` directory entirely
- Updated `.frontmatter-schema.json`: removed `command` from type enum, added
  skill-specific fields (`user-invocable`, `argument-hint`, `allowed-tools`,
  `disable-model-invocation`)
- Removed `command` from `COMPONENT_TYPES` in Python extension management code
- Removed command template from `skills/claude-code-management/templates/`
- Updated extension taxonomy from WHO/WHAT/HOW/CONTEXT to WHO/HOW/CONTEXT
  (Subagents/Skills/Knowledge)

#### Knowledge Documentation Rewrite

- Rewrote `extension-types.md` with updated decision tree (no Command branch)
- Rewrote `framework-design-principles.md` removing Command sections
- Updated `design-patterns.md`, `plugin-development.md`, `claude-md-files.md`,
  and `hooks.md` to reflect skills-only taxonomy
- Updated `schemas.md` with skill-specific field documentation and examples

#### User-Facing Documentation Updates

- Removed `docs/HOWTO_CREATE_COMMAND.md`
- Updated all HOWTO guides, Getting Started, Install Guide, Development Guide,
  Examples, and Architecture docs
- Updated C4 container and context diagrams (merged Commands container into Skills)
- Updated CI workflow, CODEOWNERS, and integration test scripts

### Fixed

- Fixed agent `model` frontmatter using invalid `claude-sonnet-4.5` model ID;
  changed to `sonnet` alias which resolves to latest Sonnet at runtime

---

## [0.7.0] - 2026-02-16

### Added

#### Auto-generate Agent Routing Directives (#12)

- Agent discovery scans three sources in priority order: project
  (`{project}/.claude/agents/`), user (`~/.claude/agents/`), and
  plugin-provided agents (via `aida-config.json` manifest)
- YAML frontmatter parsing reads agent metadata (name, description,
  version, tags, skills, model) with `yaml.safe_load()`
- Auto-generates `## Available Agents` section in project CLAUDE.md
  with routing directives for each discovered agent
- Marker-based idempotent updates — re-running config replaces the
  managed section without duplicating or losing manual content
- Agent Teams guidance included so team leads and teammates know
  when to consult domain-specific agents
- First-found-wins deduplication (project > user > plugin priority)

### Changed

- `_safe_read_file` in plugins.py now accepts `max_size` parameter
  (defaults to 1MB for backward compatibility, agents use 500KB)
- `aida-config.json` supports `agents` key declaring plugin agent
  names (falls back to directory scanning if absent)
- Phase 1 (`get_questions`) discovers agents and returns metadata
- Phase 2 (`configure`) updates CLAUDE.md with routing directives

### Security

- Agent file reading reuses TOCTOU-safe `_safe_read_file` with
  `O_NOFOLLOW`, size limits, and path containment checks
- Symlinked directories and files rejected during agent scanning

---

## [0.6.1] - 2026-02-16

### Fixed

#### Plugin Validator Compatibility (#13)

- Moved `config` and `recommendedPermissions` from `plugin.json` to new
  `aida-config.json` to resolve Claude Code plugin validator rejecting
  unrecognized keys
- Plugin discovery reads AIDA-specific fields from `aida-config.json`
  (strict separation, no fallback to `plugin.json`)

### Security

- TOCTOU-safe file reading with `O_NOFOLLOW` in plugin discovery and
  permission scanner (eliminates symlink race conditions)
- Directory-level symlink rejection for `.claude-plugin` directories
- Consistent `isinstance(data, dict)` validation at all JSON parse boundaries
- Reordered symlink check before `stat()` in permissions CLI

---

## [0.6.0] - 2026-02-15

### Added

#### User-Level Memento Storage (#3)

- Mementos stored at `~/.claude/memento/` (user-level, branch-independent)
- Project namespacing with `{project}--{slug}.md` filenames
- Auto-detected `project:` frontmatter block (name, path, repo, branch)
- List filtering: defaults to current project, `--all` for all projects,
  `--project <name>` for a specific project
- Completed mementos archived to `~/.claude/memento/.completed/`

#### Project-Level Permissions (#6, #9)

- Common development commands run without permission prompts
- Destructive operations still require confirmation
- Added Edit, Write, and NotebookEdit to allowed tools

### Changed

- Migrated from monorepo to standalone repository (#1)
- Adopted marketplace-centric distribution strategy (#2)
- Replaced custom YAML frontmatter parser with PyYAML `safe_load`

### Security

- Atomic file writes via tempfile + `os.replace` with 0o600 permissions
- Path containment validation with symlink rejection
- YAML injection prevention via `| tojson` in Jinja2 templates
- Regex backreference injection prevention via lambda replacements
- Git URL credential sanitization across all URL schemes
- Directory permissions enforced via `os.chmod(0o700)` after `mkdir`
- Input validation: slug format/length, project name, JSON size limits

---

## [0.2.0] - 2025-11-05

### Added

#### New `/aida` Command Dispatcher

- Unified command interface for all AIDA functionality
- 8 subcommands: config, status, doctor, upgrade, feedback, bug, feature-request, help
- Skill-based architecture with `aida-dispatch` skill

#### Smart Configuration System

- `/aida config` - Intelligent configuration menu with state detection
- Auto-detects installation state (global/project)
- Context-aware menu options (shows only relevant choices)
- Handles both initial setup AND updates
- "View current configuration" option

#### YAML-Based Configuration (Major Innovation)

- Auto-detection of 90% of project facts
- Single source of truth in `.claude/aida-project-context.yml`
- Detects: VCS (Git, worktrees, remotes), files (README, LICENSE, etc.), languages, tools
- Infers: project type, team size, documentation level
- **Massive question reduction: 22 questions → 2 questions!**

#### New Diagnostic Commands

- `/aida status` - Show installation and configuration status
- `/aida doctor` - Comprehensive health check with fix suggestions
- `/aida upgrade` - Check for updates and show upgrade instructions

#### Project Context Skill

- Auto-generated from YAML configuration
- Provides project-specific facts to Claude
- Updates automatically when config changes

### Changed

#### Architecture

- Migrated from `aida-core` skill to `aida-dispatch` skill
- Command dispatcher delegates to skill (cleaner separation)
- Scripts use YAML config instead of complex conditional logic

#### Configuration Flow

- Replaced questionnaire conditionals with fact detection
- Configuration saved to YAML before asking questions
- Skills rendered from YAML (not from questionnaire responses)

### Improved

- **User Experience**: Fewer questions, smarter defaults
- **Transparency**: Config file is human-readable YAML
- **Idempotency**: Can run config multiple times safely
- **Error Handling**: Better error messages with actionable suggestions
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive references and architecture docs

### Technical

#### New Scripts

- `scripts/detect.py` - Detect installation state
- Enhanced `scripts/configure.py` - YAML-based configuration
- Enhanced fact detection functions

#### New Utilities

- `utils/files.py` - Added `write_yaml()` function
- Enhanced `detect_project_info()` with structured schema
- New `detect_vcs_info()` and `detect_files()` functions

#### New Reference Documentation

- `references/config-driven-approach.md` - Architecture guide
- `references/project-facts.md` - Comprehensive fact taxonomy
- `docs/architecture/adr/007-yaml-config-single-source-truth.md` - ADR

### Fixed

- N/A (initial release of dispatcher)

### Deprecated

- Old `aida-core` skill (replaced by `aida-dispatch`)

### Security

- Validates YAML file sizes (max 1MB)
- Validates JSON payloads (max 1MB, max depth 10)
- Path validation prevents system directory access
- Template variable validation prevents injection

---

## [0.1.8] - 2025-11-04
