Do you want to reinstall? This will overwrite your existing preferences.

[y/N]: _
```

**Choices:**
- `N` (default): Exit and keep existing installation
- `y`: Overwrite with new preferences (current skills will be backed up)

**Backup location**: `~/.claude/skills/.backup-TIMESTAMP/`

#### 2.3 Interactive Questionnaire

AIDA will ask 5 questions to customize your experience:

```
Let's learn about your coding preferences and work patterns.
This takes about 2 minutes.

Press Ctrl+C at any time to cancel.

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
```

See [Questionnaire Deep Dive](#questionnaire-deep-dive) below for detailed explanations of each question.

#### 2.4 Skill Creation

**Total time**: ~3-5 minutes

## Questionnaire Deep Dive

The installation questionnaire asks 5 questions that shape how AIDA works for you.

### Question 1: Coding Standards

```
What coding standards and style guides do you follow?

Examples: PEP 8, Airbnb JavaScript, PSR-12 PHP, custom team conventions

Your answer: _
```

**Purpose**: Ensures Claude generates code matching your standards

**Good answers:**
- "PEP 8 for Python, Airbnb style for JavaScript"
- "Google style guides with custom team modifications"
- "Standard Go formatting, ESLint Recommended config"
- "PSR-12 for PHP, PHPUnit for tests"

**Bad answers:**
- "Whatever works" (too vague)
- Leaving blank (no context for AIDA)

**Impact**: High - affects all code generation across all projects

### Question 2: Work Hours and Patterns

```
What are your typical working hours and patterns?

Choose one:
  [1] Traditional 9-5 schedule
  [2] Flexible hours with core overlap
  [3] Remote/async with no fixed schedule
  [4] Deep work blocks in morning, meetings afternoon
  [5] Evening/night work preferred

Your choice [2]: _
```

**Purpose**: Helps AIDA understand when you're focused vs. available

**Default**: Option 2 (Flexible hours with core overlap)

**Considerations:**
- **Option 1**: Traditional schedule, prefer structured days
- **Option 2**: Flexible but have team overlap times
- **Option 3**: Fully async, work whenever
- **Option 4**: Protect deep work time in mornings
- **Option 5**: Night owl, work evenings/nights

**Impact**: Low - informational for future features

### Question 3: Communication Style

```
What communication style do you prefer from AIDA?

Choose one:
  [1] Direct and concise - just the essentials
  [2] Detailed with context and examples
  [3] Conversational and friendly

  [5] Balanced - detailed when needed, concise otherwise

Your choice [5]: _
```

**Purpose**: Shapes how Claude responds to you

**Default**: Option 5 (Balanced)

**Choose based on preference:**
- **Option 1**: Busy, want quick answers
- **Option 2**: Learning, want explanations
- **Option 3**: Enjoy friendly interactions
- **Option 4**: Experienced, want precision
- **Option 5**: Situational - adapt to context

**Impact**: Medium - affects response tone and detail

### Question 4: Primary Development Tools

- Frameworks (Django, React, Laravel, etc.)
- Editors (VS Code, Vim, IntelliJ, etc.)
- Tools (Docker, Git, Make, etc.)
- Services (AWS, GitHub, Vercel, etc.)

**Impact**: High - affects tool suggestions and examples

### Question 5: Decision Tracking Detail

```
How detailed should AIDA's decision tracking be?

Choose one:
  [1] Minimal - only major architectural decisions
  [2] Moderate - key decisions and trade-offs
  [3] Detailed - track most technical choices
  [4] Comprehensive - document everything possible

Your choice [2]: _
```

**Purpose**: Controls decision logging verbosity

**Default**: Option 2 (Moderate)

**Choose based on needs:**
- **Option 1**: Small projects, don't need much history
- **Option 2**: Typical projects, important decisions only
- **Option 3**: Complex projects, lots of choices
- **Option 4**: Enterprise, compliance, audit trails

**Impact**: Medium - affects future decision tracking features

## Troubleshooting

### Installation Fails

#### Error: "Python version not supported"

**Cause**: Python < 3.8 installed

**Solution**:
```bash
# Check version
python3 --version

# Upgrade Python (macOS)
brew upgrade python3

# Upgrade Python (Linux)
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade python3

# Try again
/aida install
```

#### Error: "gh CLI not found"

**Cause**: GitHub CLI not installed

**Solution**:
```bash
# Install gh (macOS)
brew install gh

# Install gh (Linux)
# See https://cli.github.com/

# Authenticate
gh auth login

# Try again
/aida install
```

#### Error: "Permission denied: ~/.claude/"

**Cause**: Insufficient permissions on Claude directory

**Solution**:
```bash
# Check permissions
ls -la ~/.claude/

# Fix permissions
chmod -R u+w ~/.claude/

# Verify fix
/aida doctor
```

### Questionnaire Issues

#### Accidentally Canceled (Ctrl+C)

**Solution**: Just run `/aida install` again. No partial state is saved.

#### Want to Change Answers

**Solution**: Run `/aida install` again and confirm overwrite when prompted.

#### Unsure How to Answer

**Tip**: Use the defaults! You can always reinstall later to change answers.

Press Enter without typing to use the default value shown in `[brackets]`.

### Verification Fails

#### Skills Don't Appear in `/aida skill list`

**Possible causes:**
1. Installation didn't complete
2. Syntax errors in SKILL.md
3. Wrong directory permissions

**Solution**:
```bash
# Run health check
/aida doctor

# Look for errors, follow suggestions

# If needed, reinstall
/aida install
```

#### `/aida` commands not recognized

**Possible cause**: Plugin not enabled

**Solution**:
```bash
# Check plugin status
/plugin list

# Should show:
# aida-core@aida (enabled)

# If not enabled
/plugin enable aida-core@aida
```

### Getting More Help

If problems persist:

1. **Run diagnostics**: `/aida doctor` (shows detailed errors)
2. **Check status**: `/aida status` (shows configuration)
3. **Report bug**: `/aida bug` (opens GitHub issue with auto-filled environment)
4. **Ask for help**: `/aida feedback` (general help request)
